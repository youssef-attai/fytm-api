# Free YouTube Music

This API allows you to stream music from YouTube for free.

## How it works

Users can search for their favorite _tracks_ and get links to
audio files that can be used in media streaming.

If they 
could not find the track they are looking for, 
they can add it to the app by providing the track's metadata
(e.g. the title, artist, album, etc.)
and the YouTube video ID
(i.e. the gibberish after **v=** in: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ).

The tracks are saved to the database so that everyone can find it next time
they search for it.

Users can do the same with _artists_ and _albums_.

They can also create an account to make their personal _playlists_.
